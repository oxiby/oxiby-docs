# Exploring Oxiby further

You made it to the end of the Oxiby language guide!
Congratulations and thank you for reading.
If you have any feedback on the guide you'd like to share, you can do so by [opening an issue](https://github.com/oxiby/oxiby-docs/issues).
It would be very much appreciated!

If you want to dive in deeper, proceed to the standard library or language references.

If you want to work on Oxiby itself, you'll need to learn Rust and Ruby.

A good place to start learning Rust is its official documentation: [https://rust-lang.org/learn/](https://rust-lang.org/learn/).
Rust's documentation includes a guide called "the book" which is very much like this one.
You'll find that Rust is very similar to Oxiby.
Now that you've finished the Oxiby guide, Rust should feel familiar.

Ruby's official documentation also has lots of resources that will be useful in learning Ruby: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/).

Now go write some Oxiby programs!
